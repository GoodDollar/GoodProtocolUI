IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE GOODDAPP WINDOW OPEN FOR THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. Do not close the GoodDapp window until after Step 4 (below).
                
                2.Start and complete the KYC process by following the steps provided by the Onramp partner. You may have to take a picture of your national ID and a selfie. Once you're verified, you'll receive e-mail confirmation from the Onramp partner and be asked to complete the purchase.
                
                3.Complete your payment through the payment provider.
                Once you have confirmation from the payment provider that your funds were successfully purchased, return to the GoodDapp window to trigger the Swap.`

                Additionally, your payment itself can fail for various reasons. If you‚Äôve paid with a credit card, the most common reasons for failed orders are:
                ¬∑ you used someone else‚Äôs credit card or inputted the wrong billing address
                ¬∑ your issuing bank declined the credit card authorization
                ¬∑ your bank does not support crypto-acquisitions
                ¬∑ incorrect billing info
                If you‚Äôve paid with a bank transfer, the most common reasons for failed orders are:
                ¬∑ you‚Äôve sent the transfer from someone else‚Äôs bank account
                ¬∑ you haven‚Äôt included the reference number provided to you

                üåé Some jurisdictions may not support crypto purchases, so your verification or transaction may have failed because of your location.
                
                üí≥ Some payment types (like pre-paid cards) may not be supported by all of Onramper‚Äôs service providers.`
