        question: `Who can use it?`,
        answer: `Anyone can use the MicroBridge, but there are a few requirements to ensure a smooth transfer of your G$ tokens:\n\n1. Wallet Compatibility: Verify that your wallet is compatible with both the Fuse and Celo networks. Sending G$ to incompatible wallets will result in the loss of funds.\n\n2. Fees and Gas: Using the MicroBridge requires G$ tokens for fees and native tokens to cover gas fees on these networks. Make sure you have sufficient balances. See below ‚ÄúWhat are the fees for using the MicroBridge?‚Äù for more details.\n\n3. Transaction Limits: You may bridge up to 5M G$ per transaction, with a daily limit of 30M G$ per wallet.`,

        question: `How does it work?`,
        answer: `The MicroBridge is a combination of 2 smart contracts: one deployed on each chain that allows for cross-chain transfers of value. Your funds are sent to one contract which burns them on the source chain and mints them on the destination chain.`,

    {
        id: 'whatfeesmicrobridge',
        question: `What are the fees for using the MicroBridge?`,
        answer: `The fee for using the MicroBridge is 0.15% per transaction (minimum 10 G$, maximum 1M G$), which covers operation of the MicroBridge node. All MicroBridge transactions incur gas fees in the native network tokens (Fuse or Celo).\n\nIf you choose to Self-Relay to expedite your transaction, 50% of the MicroBridge fee will be refunded. However please note that Self-Relaying will cause you to incur additional gas fees.`,

        answer: `The Buy G$ tool allows you to use your local currency to purchase GoodDollars. You can buy using a variety of methods which vary by your country and jurisdiction. The widget in this page is a third-party service provided by Onramper, which works with a variety of service providers that facilitate purchasing through other channels (such as banks, mobile money providers and credit cards). As such GoodDollar does not have access to any of the information you share while using this tool and cannot offer support with your transaction.`,

        id: 'howwork',
        question: `How does it work?`,

IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE GOODDAPP WINDOW OPEN FOR THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. Do not close the GoodDapp window until after Step 4 (below).

2.Start and complete the KYC process by following the steps provided by the Onramp partner. You may have to take a picture of your national ID and a selfie. Once you're verified, you'll receive e-mail confirmation from the Onramp partner and be asked to complete the purchase.

3.Complete your payment through the payment provider.
Once you have confirmation from the payment provider that your funds were successfully purchased, return to the GoodDapp window to trigger the Swap.`,

        id: 'txfail',
        question: `Why did my verification or transaction fail?`,
        answer: `Many sellers, such as Moonpay, require you to provide information on who you are, sometimes including an upload of your ID/passport. In case you do not pass this identity verification, your order will fail.

Additionally, your payment itself can fail for various reasons. If you‚Äôve paid with a credit card, the most common reasons for failed orders are:
¬∑ you used someone else‚Äôs credit card or inputted the wrong billing address
¬∑ your issuing bank declined the credit card authorization
¬∑ your bank does not support crypto-acquisitions
¬∑ incorrect billing info
If you‚Äôve paid with a bank transfer, the most common reasons for failed orders are:
¬∑ you‚Äôve sent the transfer from someone else‚Äôs bank account
¬∑ you haven‚Äôt included the reference number provided to you
¬∑ you have sent an incorrect amount

üåé Some jurisdictions may not support crypto purchases, so your verification or transaction may have failed because of your location.

üí≥ Some payment types (like pre-paid cards) may not be supported by all of Onramper‚Äôs service providers.`,
